        "We will be re-using our county-level health data `health` obtained from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html) to investigate [Social Determinants of Health](https://www.cdc.gov/about/sdoh/index.html). You can find the explanations to the columns in the data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ziqi-Li/GIS5122/main/data/cdc_county_health.txt).\n",
        "\n",
        "You are also given a county-level socio-demographic dataset `socio_demo` obtaiend from the American Community Survey (2015-2019) dataset. Variable name explanations can be seen [here](https://github.com/Ziqi-Li/GIS5122/blob/main/data/acs_2019_variables.txt).\n",

        "Below are specific tasks you need to perform and their credits (total 100%):\n",
        "1. Create a `GeoDataFrame` by merging the `health`, the `socio_demo` and the `counties` boundary together. Code is given.\n",
        "2. Choose **ONE** health outcome of your interest. Make a map of the health outcome to show its spatial distribution. (**5%**)\n",
        "3. Build a linear regression model (OLS) with the health outcome as the dependent variable, and socio-demographic variables as the independent variables. You are supposed to tweak the model specification based on your own understanding of the potential relationships. Optionally but not required, you can use the forward/backward/stepwise selection code (autoselect.py) to help you decide which predictors you want to include in your model. Report and interpret your linear regression results regarding your model R2, regression coefficients, and statistical significance of the coefficients. (**30%**)\n",
        "5. Create a residual vs fit plot and a Q-Q plot to check the model residual assumptions. Describe whether the patterns in these plots noticeably violate any of the LINE regression assumptions. In this speficic assignment, you are only expected to diagnose issues but you don't need to fix the issues. (**10%**)\n",
        "6. Make a map of the residuals to examine spatial autocorrelation. Then compute Moran's I value of the residuals based on Queen-contiguity spatial weights matrix. Interpret the Moran's I value and its statistical significance. (**15%**)\n",
        "7. Fit both a spatial lag model and a spatial error model and cross compare all three methods (slm, sem, ols) and indicate which model we should use based on the evidence from 1) AIC; 2) L-M test and 3) residual spatial autocorrelation. (**40%**)\n",
